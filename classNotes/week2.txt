look at the data for the project: https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets
Module 1
slide 5: processing, analyzing and handleing large amoutns of data and high volume and velocity 
slide 6: log data, lot of information with lots of different formats, allows for more insights
slide 7: 
    social media- any project that relate to users and their behavior, 

    machine data - large data from ex: GPS devices, user interactions / nothing to do user behaior, where is the user located, where they are scrolling, where are are swiping located without asking the user , car monitors and motion sensory detections - from third party , 

    iot (internet of things)devices to sources of big data / like : smart devices, so anything that is connected to the internet / security camers like ring / smart fridge or smart kitchen devices / moition dectors/ alarm systems / 
    ex: timestamps for the screen data 

    important to understand and able to analysis this data 

slide 8: zettabyte 
estimate of data user data / snapshot of data used 
new social media platforms/ chatbots / a lot of AI generated data : image, text, voice, etc
 
 slide 9: 
 slide 10: 
 slide 12: 
    database - tablular / can query 
    datawarehouse - stores sturctued, cleaned, and processed data / similar to database 
        both have tables 
        both have rows and columns and can related to other tables 
        fold the table based on time (month)?
        data cubed : is a cubed of data based on argreeation  
    data lake - stores raw unstructured data in its native 

    can query all data : might need speical tools 
Slide 13: Big Data Analytics 
slide 14
slide 15: customer data is as valuable as the customer 
    having data allows improvment 
slide 16: example banking 
slide 17: example big data from manufacturing and industry 
slide 18: example of big data to respond to the market and area and traffic 
slide 19: example use analysis to improve customer experience / a lot of ideas to 
slide 20: what big data cannot do 
    still need the experts: domain experts 
    need a business model how to run the company: ads, subscription based, price each item , freebie with ads 
    need to account for data shifts and data will change over time 
slide 23: 
    waterfall method :
    spiral method 
    agile 
    pipeline method
        1: evaluate the what we want to find 
        2: where will the data come from
        3: data filtering 
        4: data etraction to the way we want to work with example: tiktok short we want the statitics but not the video itself 
        5: ...
slide 24: 
    description: what has happened/ what has happend in the past, example: enrollment patterns, etc
    predictive analysis: regression / classification to predict unseen data 
    diagnostic analytics: (not well-knonw) what happened and why did it happend / complicated and not straight forward to what happend /example: why did the customer did not buy a specific product 
    prescriptive analysis: (not well-knonw) how to handel a spefiic solution / solve a problem 

slide 28: tools for big data 
slide 31: pie chart / a lot of retails / telecom are vendors and not users - pass through the data 
    industry using big data but not producing data 
    out-box thinking and support of idea to make a big data analysis / people want to results 
slide 32: e-commerce

JSON / historical data : 

SQL - postgres : host on the computer science 
micro-surfaces 
hive / postgress - meta data 
casandra - data 
mongoDB - data 
impletement the tools the data in different aspects 
queries and machine learning needs 

real time data / data
Summary: will be using ML channel: want they are looking for 
 NExt week: data you want to collect from the food Database : dont put in the database
